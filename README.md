# MameLaunch
A basic launcher for a Mame Cabinet using Windows.

I wanted to create a front end for a MAME cocktail table I was building.  I looked through the main list of front ends but they were either 
difficult to configure or just did way more than I wanted.

This launcher is windows based and leverages C# .NET and the embeeded browser control as the front end.  This is a work in progress and I'm 
tring to simplfy a bit of the code to make customizing it a bit easier.

Here's a video of a demo running the current configuration:

The majority of the code can be found in the Recsoures/UI folder and is pretty straight forward JavaScript and CSS.
